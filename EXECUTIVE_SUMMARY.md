## 🔴 Critical Blockers (10 Issues)

### Tier 1: Showstoppers (Can't Ship Without These)

2. **404 Page Auditing** - Auditing error pages for SEO issues
3. **Missing Local SEO** - No GBP/NAP/local schema section
4. **Empty Competitor Analysis** - Paid add-on shows "nothing found"
5. **Tier Mismatch** - Report says "Standard" when client ordered "Advanced"

### Tier 2: Quality Issues (Hurt Credibility)
6. **Duplicate URLs** - Same URL twice in page table
7. **Garbage Keywords** - "tconne cted website domain"
8. **Generic Instructions** - "Consult web server docs" not helpful
9. **Favicon as Social Media** - `x.com/favicon` detected as Twitter profile
