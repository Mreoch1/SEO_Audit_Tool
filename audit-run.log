📊 QA Score: 7/10 (Target: 9/10)

📊 Report Quality Assurance Results
   Score: 7/10 ❌ FAILED
   Critical Issues: 1
   Warnings: 1

🚨 Critical Issues:
   ❌ [Readability Formula] Rendering percentage shows 0% but HTML is 95.5% similar
      Expected: ~4.5% rendering (or 95.5% similarity)
      Actual: 0% rendering
      Fix: When rendered < initial: renderingPercentage = similarity > 95 ? (100 - similarity) : ((initial - rendered) / initial * 100)

⚠️  Warnings:
   ⚠️  [Narrative Consistency] Summary narrative may contradict scores
      Expected: Narrative matches score levels (excellent = 90+, good = 70-89, needs improvement = <70)
      Actual: Narrative may claim "excellent" despite low scores
